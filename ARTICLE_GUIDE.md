# Article and solution guide

Every problem gets two files, both keyed by its TUF ID (the `id` field in `_data/problems.json`):

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `p/<id>.md` | The article. Jekyll renders it at `/p/<id>.html`. |
| `java/P<id>_<CamelName>.java` | All approaches as static methods in one class, plus a `main` with assertions. |

## Problem
Own-words statement, constraints, then 2 examples each with a one-line explanation.

## Approach 1: Brute force
**Intuition.** 2-4 sentences: the obvious thing and why it is slow.
**Algorithm.** Numbered steps.
```java
// code copied verbatim from the Java file's method
```
**Complexity.** Time O(..), Space O(..), with one line of justification each.

## Approach 2: Better           (only when a genuinely distinct middle step exists)
same structure

## Approach 3: Optimal
same structure, plus a short **Dry run** table on example 1 when it helps.

## Edge cases and pitfalls
Bullets: empty input, duplicates, overflow (int vs long), negative numbers, off-by-one.

## Related problems
Bullets linking to other articles by id: [Title]({{ "/p/<id>.html" | relative_url }})
```

Rules:
- Explain like a strong mentor: why the approach works, not just what it does. No filler, no marketing.
- Theory rows (patterns, "Introduction to DP", "MST theory", language basics) get a **concept article**: explanation, worked examples, and Java code for every pattern or construct shown.
- Code blocks in the article must be byte-identical to the methods in the Java file (copy them after the tests pass).
- Never write `{{` or `{%` inside code unless escaped with `{% raw %}...{% endraw %}` (Liquid runs on the page).
- Keep each article self-contained; do not assume the reader has read earlier ones.

## Java file rules (`java/P<id>_<CamelName>.java`)

- Java 21, single public class named exactly like the file, no package statement.
- One static method per approach: `bruteForce(...)`, `better(...)`, `optimal(...)`; descriptive names are fine when there are several optimal variants (e.g. `optimalHashMap`).
- Helper types (ListNode, TreeNode, Pair) are nested static classes inside the same file so every file compiles on its own.
- `public static void main(String[] args)` runs at least 4 test cases through every approach using the `check` helper below, including an edge case. Print `OK <ClassName>` at the end.
- No `Scanner`/stdin, no randomness without a fixed seed, run time under 2 seconds.

```java
static void check(boolean cond, String msg) {
    if (!cond) throw new AssertionError(msg);
}
```
